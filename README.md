Level Control Trainer
===================

In this project (PFE), we have designed, built and tested a level
control trainer  plant. As acquisition elements we used flow
transmitters (a DP cell plus an orifice plate) and a tank level
transmitter (DP cell). The actuator is a globe valve pneumatically
powered (Foxboro Stabilflo V1). The whole process is controlled by a
Programmable Logic Controller (PLC), which executes corrective actions
in order to follow a given set-point. In addition, the PLC
communicates with a supervisory computer running a SCADA program . The
state of the plant can be observed remotely.Furthermore, the level
set-point can be modified throw this SCADA program.
